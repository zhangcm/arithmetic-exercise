/**
 * 1024. Video Stitching [medium]
 *
 * You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted time seconds.
 * These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varying lengths.
 *
 * Each video clip is described by an array clips where clips[i] = [starti, endi] indicates that
 * the ith clip started at starti and ended at endi.
 *
 * We can cut these clips into segments freely.
 *
 * For example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments [0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7].
 * Return the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that
 * cover the entire sporting event [0, time]. If the task is impossible, return -1.
 *
 * Input: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], time = 10
 * Output: 3
