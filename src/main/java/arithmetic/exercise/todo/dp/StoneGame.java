/**
 * 877. Stone Game
 * Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an even number of piles arranged in a row,
 * and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].
 *
 * The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The total number of stones across all the
 * piles is odd, so there are no ties.
 *
 * Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones
 * either from the beginning or from the end of the row. This continues until there are no more piles left,
 * at which point the person with the most stones wins.
 *
 * Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice wins the game, or false if Bob wins.
 *
 * Input: piles = [5,3,4,5]
 * Output: true
 * Input: piles = [3,7,2,3]
 * Output: true
