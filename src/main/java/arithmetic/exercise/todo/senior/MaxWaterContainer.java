/**
 * 盛最多水的容器
 *
 * Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
 *
 * Notice that you may not slant the container.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
 * Output: 49
 *
 * Input: height = [1,1]
 * Output: 1
 *
 * Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
 * Output: 16
